# Blazor Server-Side Pizza Ordering Application
This repository contains a Blazor Server-Side application that allows users to order pizzas. The application is built using the Blazor framework, which enables the development of interactive web user interfaces using C# instead of JavaScript.

# Features
#### Pizza Menu: 
The application displays a menu of pizzas available for order.
#### Order Placement: 
Users can select their desired pizza, specify the quantity, and place an order.
#### Order Tracking: 
After placing an order, users can track the status of their order in real time.
#### User-friendly UI: 
The application has a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and place orders.

# Technologies Used
#### Blazor Server-Side: 
This model of Blazor runs the client-side C# code directly on the server. When an event occurs, the UI state is updated and a UI diff is sent to the browser over a SignalR connection.
#### SignalR: 
This library is used for handling real-time updates, which is essential for tracking the status of pizza orders.

This application serves as a great starting point for learning about Blazor and its capabilities in building interactive web applications using C#. Contributions to improve this project are welcome!
